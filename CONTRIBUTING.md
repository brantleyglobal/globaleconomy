# Welcome to Global Economy 2 Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to Global Economy!

This guide aims to provide an overview of the contribution workflow to help us make the contribution process effective for everyone involved.

## About the Project

Global Economy is a minimal and forkable repo providing builders with a starter kit to build decentralized applications on Global-Dominion.

Read the [README](README.md) to get an overview of the project.

### Vision

The goal of Global Economy is to provide the primary building blocks for a decentralized application.

The repo can be forked to include integrations and more features, but we want to keep the `main` branch simple and minimal.

### Project Status

The project is under active development.

You can view the open Issues, follow the development process, and contribute to the project.

### Rules

1. All code contributions require an Issue to be created and agreed upon by core contributors before submitting a Pull Request. This ensures proper discussion, alignment, and consensus on the proposed changes.
2. Contributors must be humans, not bots.
3. First-time contributions must not contain only spelling or grammatical fixes.

## Getting started

You can contribute to this repo in many ways:

- Solve open issues
- Report bugs or feature requests
- Improve the documentation

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributions:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Contributions should only fix/add the functionality in the issue OR address style issues, not both.
- If you're running into an error, please give context. Explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce the error.
- Please use the same formatting in the code repository. You can configure your IDE to do it by using the prettier / linting config files included in each package.
- If applicable, please edit the README.md file to reflect the changes.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If a contributor is working on the issue, they will be assigned to the individual. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to assign it to yourself and open a PR with a fix for it.

#### Create a new issue

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

Some tips to follow when you are creating an issue:

- Provide as much context as possible. Over-communicate to give the most details to the reader.
- Include the steps to reproduce the issue or the reason for adding the feature.
- Screenshots, videos, etc., are highly appreciated.
