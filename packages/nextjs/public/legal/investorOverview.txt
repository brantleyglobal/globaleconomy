Important Investment Disclosure – Global Dominion Ecosystem > > Global Dominion (GBD) operates an asset-backed ecosystem in which investments are directly tied to products and services within the platform. By investing in GBD, participants are supporting the underlying economy of the ecosystem. > > The system offers dividend payouts based on the chosen investment cycle, with a minimum term of one quarter (3 months). At the end of each quarter, investors receive any earned dividends, and—if the selected investment cycle has matured—the original investment amount is also returned. > > All investments and payouts are subject to defined grace periods, which account for processing timelines and potential delays due to operational or market conditions. > > While the GBD model is designed with real-world asset backing and operational safeguards, investing in this ecosystem involves risk. Due to unforeseen market, liquidity, or internal disruptions, there may be delays in capital return, reductions in payout, or—in extreme circumstances—a complete loss of invested capital. > > In situations where funds cannot be returned at maturity, settlements will be processed as promptly as possible, and we are committed to clear, consistent communication. > > Investors are encouraged to carefully assess their personal risk tolerance and consult a financial advisor before participating.
